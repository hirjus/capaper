"This paper provides empirically-based criteria for selecting Items and countries
to develop measures of an underlying construct of interest that are comparable in
cross-national research. Using data from the 1994 International Social Survey
Program and applying multiple correspondence analysis to a set of common items
in each of the 24 participating countries, we show that both the quality of the
data, as well as its underlying structure - and therefore meaning - vary
considerably between countries. The approach we use for screening countries and
items is especially useful in situations where the psychometric properties of
the items have not been well established in previous research."
